# What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that allows you to develop, ship, and run applications inside lightweight, portable containers. A container is an isolated environment that contains everything an application needs to run: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. This ensures that your application works seamlessly across different environments, whether that's on a developer's laptop, in a test environment, or in production.

## Key Concepts:
- **Containers**: These are the environments that Docker creates. They encapsulate an application and all its dependencies.
- **Images**: These are blueprints for containers. Docker images are reusable templates from which containers are instantiated.
- **Docker Engine**: This is the runtime environment that runs and manages Docker containers.

## Why do you need Docker?
- **Portability**: Docker containers can run consistently across any platform that supports Docker, whether it’s your laptop, cloud infrastructure, or on-premise servers.
- **Isolation**: Each container is isolated from others, which helps avoid dependency conflicts and issues related to different software environments.
- **Scalability**: You can run multiple containers and scale your services up or down efficiently.
- **Version Control**: Docker allows you to version your application’s dependencies and configurations, making it easier to manage upgrades or rollbacks.
- **DevOps Friendly**: Docker is a key tool in DevOps pipelines for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).
